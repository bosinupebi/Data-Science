Approach


Determine demand function using two years of bookings for the guest suite and party room
intercept+(slope*price)=Quantity
	Using a linear regression, the models are as follows:
Guest Suite: 
3.2463+(-0.009*price)=Quantity

Party Room:
34.4945+(-1.1492*price)=Quantity
NB: this function will need to be updated at an agreed time interval
	Determine the revenue equation by multiplying the demand function by price

(〖Quantity〗^2/slope)+ (intercept/slope*quantity)=Revenue

	Take the first derivative of the revenue equation with respect to price, set it to zero and solve price, to determine optimal pricing
-intercept/(2*Slope)=P_opt


Create a table that stores the Popt, slope and intercept for the
